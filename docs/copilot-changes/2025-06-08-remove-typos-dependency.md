# Copilot Changes - Remove Typos Dependency

**Date**: June 8, 2025
**Change Type**: Dependency Cleanup
**Scope**: Development toolchain simplification

## Summary

Removed the `typos` spell checking tool from the project development dependencies and associated configuration. This simplifies the development toolchain while maintaining all core quality assurance capabilities (linting, formatting, testing).

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

#### `pyproject.toml`
- Removed `"typos>=1.16.0"` from dev dependencies
- All other dependencies remain intact

#### `Makefile`
- Removed `type-check` target (was incorrectly named - was running spell check, not type checking)
- Updated `all-checks` target to remove dependency on removed `type-check` target
- All other Make targets remain functional

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Removed typos repository and hook configuration
- All other pre-commit hooks remain active (ruff, standard hooks)

### Verification Performed

All development workflows verified to work correctly after removal:

- ✅ **Tests**: 31 tests passing with 87% coverage (above 85% requirement)
- ✅ **Linting**: `make lint` - Ruff checks pass without issues
- ✅ **Formatting**: `make format-check` - Code formatting verification works
- ✅ **Application**: `make run` - Application executes successfully
- ✅ **Pre-commit**: All remaining hooks execute without errors
- ✅ **Quality gates**: `make all-checks` completes successfully
- ✅ **Dependencies**: `uv sync --dev` updated lockfile and removed typos cleanly

## Rationale

- **Simplification**: Reduces development dependency overhead
- **Clarity**: Removes confusion around "type-check" target that wasn't actually type checking
- **Maintained Quality**: All essential quality assurance tools remain (ruff for linting/formatting, pytest for testing)
- **No Functional Impact**: Core application functionality unaffected

## Impact

- **Positive**: Cleaner dependency tree, faster setup, less tool complexity
- **Neutral**: No impact on code quality enforcement (core tools maintained)
- **None**: No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Future Considerations

If actual type checking is needed in the future, consider adding:
- `mypy` for static type analysis
- `pyright`/`pylance` for Microsoft's type checker
- `pyre` for Facebook's type checker

These would provide actual type checking capabilities (unlike typos which was spell checking).
